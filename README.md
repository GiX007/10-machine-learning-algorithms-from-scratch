# 10 Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch 

This repository contains implementations of **10 popular machine learning algorithms**, built completely from scratch in Python (no scikit-learn).  
The goal is to provide a clear, step-by-step understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.
